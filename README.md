# Python Data Structures Library
Library of data structures in Python.  

Currently contains:
* DisjointSets: Disjoint set forests with union by rank and path compression.
* Priority Queues
..* PQ: A binary heap implementation of a priority queue (with O(lg N) priority changes).
..* MaxPQ: A binary max-heap implementation of a priority queue, which extracts elements in max heap order (with O(lg N) priority changes).

Yes, that is it for now.  I will be adding much more relatively soon.  I wanted to get these up here for students currently in CSIS 4104 (at Stockton University).
